Official Cyber Monday mode, which is currently on through Monday, Nov. 27, includes both a ton of deals carried over from Black Friday plus some new ones.\n\nWe're curating a running list of Amazon's best Cyber Weekend deals, spotlighting some of our favorites and noting when good deals inevitably sell out. Read on for the full rundown, and check back often: We're going to be updating this story incessantly as the sale continues, as well as our even bigger (if you can imagine) list of Cyber Monday deals across more retailers.\n\nNote: All newly added deals are marked with a \u2728, while deals with a \ud83d\udd25 have dropped to an all-time low price. Amazon's invite-only deals for Prime members are marked with a \ud83d\udce8. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.\n\nEcho, Fire TV, and Kindle deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nAn Echo Show is a subtle yet game-changing addition to any room \u2014 and for less than $40 with this rollover Black Friday to Cyber Monday deal, there's little reason to not make your life easier. The smart screen responds to Alexa commands that are particularly handy when your hands are full, like asking for measurement conversions mid-cooking, checking the weather mid-rushing out the door, or turning off your smart lights with a sleeping kid in hand. Plus, it's got a 5.5-inch screen and better sound than its predecessor, making it perfect for watching videos or video calling friends and family.\n\nMore Amazon device and service deals\n\nAmazon services\n\nAudible Premium Plus \u2014 $5.95/month $14.95/month for four months (save $9/month; new customers only; get an additional $20 Audible credit)\n\nEcho Buds\n\nEcho smart displays\n\nEcho smart speakers\n\nFire tablets\n\nFire TVs\n\nNote: All Fire TVs come with a free 6-month subscription to MGM+ (a $35.94 value).\n\nFire TV streaming devices\n\neero\n\nKindles\n\nMiscellaneous Amazon devices\n\nApple deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nNow that the 64GB 9th generation iPad has been going in and out of stock (you might be able to find it on sale for $229.99), our new favorite iPad deal at Amazon is the 10th generation 64GB model for $349. Compared to the 9th gen, the 10th gen classic iPad has a slightly bigger screen that's now also a Liquid Retina display (10.9 inches versus 10.2 inches), a faster A14 Bionic chip for smoother multitasking, and USB-C charging.\n\nMore Apple deals\n\nAirPods\n\nMacBook\n\nMac\n\niPad\n\nApple Watch\n\nTV deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThis 65-inch Fire TV from Amazon hit its lowest ever price this month, and we're not mad about it. With a 66 percent five-star review rating, it's got much to love: Including stunning 4K QLED resolution, adaptive brightness that adjusts to the lighting of your room, the ability to project famous art or personal pics on it when not streaming anything, and, of course, that quintessential Alexa voice control.\n\nMore TV deals\n\n43 to 55 inches\n\n65 inches\n\n75 to 85 inches\n\nLaptop deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nMacBooks aside (which are all listed above in the Apple section), another stellar Cyber Monday laptop deal at Amazon is the lightweight Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 3 for $599.99. This 25% discount drops the 2023 version to the regular asking price of our favorite budget laptop, the older Surface Go 2. Compared to the Go 2, the Go 3's Intel Core i5 processor is 12th gen versus the Go 2's 11th gen, harnessing better speeds and solid power for most everyday work or school tasks. On the outside, the Go 3 is definitely giving MacBook Air \u2014 the main difference being that the Go 3's screen is a touchscreen.\n\nMore laptop deals\n\nTraditional laptops\n\n2-in-1 laptops\n\nChromebooks\n\nGaming laptops\n\nHeadphone and earbud deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nNarrowing down a headphones upgrade from so many on-sale options is less overwhelming when you've confirmed that you want to stick with a super premium, super reputable brand like Bose \u2014 but also that you want to stick to a budget. There's only one pair of Bose over-ear headphones you can grab for just under $200, and that's the QuietComfort 45s at a record-low price of $199. This classic pair secures top-of-the-line ANC, 20 hours of battery life, and all-day comfort for less than half of the AirPods Max's sale price.\n\nMore headphone and earbud deals\n\nHeadphones\n\nEarbuds\n\nTablet deals\n\nGaming deals\n\nGaming headsets\n\nMashable Deals Want more hand-picked deals in your inbox?

        "body": "ETF provider Betashares, which manages $30 billion in funds, reached an agreement to acquire Bendigo and Adelaide Bank\u2019s superannuation business, in its first venture into the superannuation sector. Betashares said it was part of a longer-term strategy to expand the business into the broader financial sector. Shares in Bendigo increased 0.6 per cent on the news. REITS (up 0.4 per cent) was the strongest sector on the index as Goodman added 0.5 per cent and Dexus climbed 2.8 per cent. The laggards Casino operator Star Entertainment Group\u2019s shares hit an all-time low of 60\u00a2 after it raised $565 million. They closed the session 16 per cent weaker at 63\u00a2. Star, which raised $800 million in February, has had to return to the market for fresh funding and is hoping to raise $750 million at a share price of 60\u00a2 a share.\n\nMeanwhile, healthcare heavyweight CSL shed 1.4 per cent, weighing down the healthcare sector and insurance companies IAG (down 2.6 per cent) and Suncorp (down 2 per cent) gave back some of their gains from Tuesday. Gold miners Newcrest (down 2.1 per cent) and Evolution (down 3.5 per cent) were also among the biggest large-cap decliners after the spot gold price dropped 0.9 per cent overnight. Information technology (down 1.1 per cent) was the weakest sector on the local bourse with WiseTech losing 1.4 per cent. The lowdown\n\nNovus Capital senior client adviser Gary Glover said the Australian sharemarket was surprisingly resilient following a negative lead from Wall Street and the latest inflation data, with markets starting to wake up to the fact that interest rates could stay higher for longer. \u201cConsidering the damage overnight in the US, Australian markets held on pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would be a bigger down day across the board.\u201d Glover said the market was volatile but quite range-bound, similar to previous periods of high inflation in the 1940s and 1970s. Elsewhere, Wall Street\u2019s ugly September got even worse on Tuesday, as a sharp drop for stocks brought them back to where they were in June. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.5 per cent for its fifth loss in the last six days. The Dow Jones dropped 1.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.6 per cent.\n\nLoading September has brought a loss of 5.2 per cent so far for the S&P 500, putting it on track to be the worst month of the year by far, as the realisation sets in that the Federal Reserve will indeed keep interest rates high for a long time. That growing understanding has sent yields in the bond market to their highest levels in more than a decade, which in turn has undercut prices for stocks and other investments. Treasury yields rose again on Tuesday following a mixed batch of reports on the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.55 per cent from 4.54 per cent late on Monday and is near its highest level since 2007. It\u2019s up sharply from about 3.5 per cent in May and from 0.5 per cent about three years ago. One economic report on Tuesday showed confidence among consumers was weaker than economists expected. That\u2019s concerning because strong spending by US households has been a bulwark keeping the economy out of a long-predicted recession.\n\nBesides high interest rates, a long list of other worries is also tugging at Wall Street. The most immediate is the threat of another US government shutdown as Capitol Hill threatens a stalemate that could shut off federal services across the country. Loading Wall Street has dealt with such shutdowns in the past, and stocks have historically been turbulent in the run-up to them, according to Lori Calvasina, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. After looking at the seven shutdowns that lasted 10 days or more since the 1970s, she found the S&P 500 dropped an average of roughly 10 per cent in the three months heading into them. But stocks managed to hold up rather well during the shutdowns, falling an average of just 0.3 per cent, before rebounding meaningfully afterward. Wall Street is also contending with higher oil prices, shaky economies around the world, a strike by US autoworkers that could put more upward pressure on inflation and a resumption of US student-loan repayments that could dent spending by households.\n\nOn Wall Street, the vast majority of stocks fell under such pressures, including 90 per cent of those within the S&P 500. Big Tech stocks tend to be among the hardest hit by high rates, and they were the heaviest weights on the index. Apple fell 2.3 per cent and Microsoft lost 1.7 per cent. Amazon tumbled 4 per cent after the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general filed an antitrust lawsuit against it. They accuse the e-commerce behemoth of using its dominant position to inflate prices on other platforms, overcharge sellers and stifle competition. In China, concerns continued over heavily indebted real estate developer Evergrande. The property market crisis there is dragging on China\u2019s economic growth and raising worries about financial instability. France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 0.7 per cent, and Germany\u2019s DAX lost 1 per cent.\n\nCrude oil prices rose, adding to worries about inflation. A barrel of benchmark US crude climbed 71\u00a2 to $US90.39. Brent crude, the international standard, added 67\u00a2 to $US93.96 per barrel. Tweet of the day Quote of the day \u201cThe Senate committees have the power to summons witnesses within Australia but have no enforceable powers for witnesses who are overseas,\u201d said Senator Bridget McKenzie as former Qantas boss Alan Joyce chose not to front the Senate select committee into the federal government\u2019s decision to reject extra flights from Qatar Airways due to \u201cpersonal commitments\u201d."

        "body": "A worker sorts out parcels in the outbound dock at the Amazon fulfillment center in Eastvale, California, on Aug. 31, 2021. Watchara Phomicinda | MediaNews Group | The Riverside Press-Enterprise via Getty Images\n\nIt was late in the day on Oct. 27, 2021, when Fred Ruckel received the dreaded automated email from Amazon . Amazon\u2019s software had detected that Ruckel\u2019s popular cat toy, called the Ripple Rug, was being sold somewhere else for a cheaper price. His product would no longer be shown in Amazon\u2019s all-important buy box, an area of the listing where shoppers click \u201cAdd to Cart.\u201d Ruckel is the sole seller of the Ripple Rug on Amazon, so the move all but ensured his product would disappear from the website, costing him thousands of dollars per day. \u201cBelow is a list of product(s) in your catalog that are not currently eligible to be the Featured Offer because they are not priced competitively compared to prices for those products from retailers outside Amazon,\u201d according to the email, which was viewed by CNBC. Unbeknownst to him, Chewy was running a discount promotion, and dropped the price of his product by a few dollars to $39.99 \u2013 less than the $43 offer on Amazon. The algorithm had flagged it as a lower offer, even though the item on Chewy cost $48.54 after shipping and taxes. Ruckel had to make a choice: Lower the price on Amazon or ask Chewy to raise the price of his product. He opted for the latter.\n\nFred Ruckel's company Snuggly Cat makes Ripple Rug, an interactive play mat for cats. Fred Ruckel\n\nNearly three years later, Ruckel\u2019s experience hits at the core of a sweeping antitrust lawsuit filed last week by the Federal Trade Commission against Amazon. The agency accused Amazon of wielding its monopoly power to squeeze merchants and thwart rivals. For consumers, that\u2019s led to artificially inflated prices and a degraded shopping experience, the agency alleges. In the 172-page suit, the FTC said Amazon relies on an \u201canti-discounting strategy\u201d and a \u201cmassive web-crawling apparatus that constantly tracks online prices\u201d to stifle competition. The agency said Amazon punishes third-party sellers who offer cheaper products elsewhere by threatening to disqualify them from appearing in the buy box if it detects a lower price. Losing the buy box is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to sellers\u2019 businesses, the complaint alleges. The end result of these tactics, the FTC argues, is elevated prices across the web. The company steadily hikes the fees it charges sellers and prevents them from discounting on other sites, so sellers often inflate their prices off of Amazon, creating an \u201cartificial price floor everywhere,\u201d according to the complaint. The FTC is seeking to hold Amazon liable for allegedly violating anti-monopoly law, though it has not yet outlined the specific remedies it believes would best resolve its concerns. In antitrust cases, remedies are often determined only after a court finds the defendant liable. In a blog post, Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky said third-party sellers set their own prices on the marketplace. The company also invests in tools to help sellers offer \u201ccompetitive prices,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with those tools, some of the businesses selling on Amazon might still choose to set prices that aren\u2019t competitive,\u201d Zapolsky said. \u201cJust like any store owner who wouldn\u2019t want to promote a bad deal to their customers, we don\u2019t highlight or promote offers that are not competitively priced.\u201d Zapolsky argued the FTC\u2019s lawsuit could force it to stop highlighting low prices, \u201ca perverse result that would be directly opposed to the goals of antitrust law.\u201d\n\n\u201cLong overdue\u201d lawsuit\n\nOn Amazon\u2019s own forum for merchants, called Seller Central, several users cheered on the FTC and said they hoped it would result in changes to the company\u2019s business practices. Amazon\u2019s tense relationship with merchants has been well-chronicled over the years, with sellers expressing a range of grievances over issues like rising fees, an arcane suspensions process, and heightened competition on the marketplace from all sides, including the e-commerce giant. \u201cI think it\u2019s great, Amazon deserves it,\u201d one person commented, adding, \u201cMore should be coming on the way.\u201d Amazon in recent years made the forum anonymous, but users must have a seller account in order to post. Another post included a screenshot of a message Amazon sent to sellers the day after the FTC filed its complaint, which said, \u201cAs your partners, we know that this news may generate questions for you and our business together. This lawsuit does not change anything about our relationship with you or how we operate today.\u201d One user called it \u201cBS verbiage,\u201d adding, \u201cBusinesses that sell in their store are indeed customers. And which of us has gotten good customer service?\u201d Another user described their experience in the last 12 months of selling on Amazon as \u201cbeing up all night at an effing casino but I'm stuck, the drugs are starting to wear off, but I'm trying to break even on the mortgage payment I'm using to play. That's how it is selling on Amazon right now to me.\u201d The seller went on to describe the experience as a \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d \u201cIt's long overdue,\" another commenter wrote. \"When they close me down, I'm applying for a job with the FTC.\u201d Still, others commented that the FTC\u2019s complaint is misguided. \u201cSelling on Amazon is a life-changing opportunity and the amount of sellers that throw stones at the platform is astounding,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nSeller skepticism\n\nEven sellers who may be sympathetic to the idea of regulating Amazon have concerns, specifically that the FTC's highlighted issues aren't necessarily ones that would make the seller and consumer experience better. Scott Needham, who sells on Amazon and runs a product-finder tool for other Amazon sellers, said he was \u201csurprised by some of the points that the FTC selected.\u201d\n\nwatch now\n\n\u201cI have over the years been very critical of Amazon,\u201d Needham told CNBC. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot of sleep because of some of the things that they have done. And the issues that they brought up, while they are interesting, they haven\u2019t created me a lot of pain.\u201d Needham said he was particularly puzzled by the inclusion of the claims that Amazon is coercive in the way it encourages sellers to use its fulfillment service, known as Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA. Needham said many sellers \u201clove FBA\u201d because of its compelling value in terms of the price and promise to deliver two-day shipping. For many, using FBA doesn\u2019t feel like a requirement, but they believe using it will make their businesses \"easier and more effective.\" \"I think that the power that Amazon wields over sellers is considerable and absolutely worth looking into,\u201d Needham said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if this would actually change that.\u201d Scott Moller, an Amazon seller and co-founder of an agency that helps merchants run their storefronts, said the e-commerce giant has removed some of the challenges that used to be part of running an online business. With FBA, he said, he can ship an item into one of Amazon\u2019s warehouses for $7.49 per package, while shipping it himself through a traditional carrier would cost him about $12. \u201cI don\u2019t have to have my own warehouse,\u201d said Moller, who sells grilling accessories on Amazon under the brand Grill Sergeant. \u201cI can use their staff, their storage, and I can instantly also take the data of advertising, so I can target ads.\u201d He also disputed the FTC\u2019s claim that Amazon has become littered with ads in search results, causing shoppers to wade through potentially less-relevant products of lesser quality. \u201cWe can tailor our ads to hit exactly the consumers we want,\u201d Moller said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect marriage of a transaction, and that\u2019s one of the beauties of what their marketplace offers.\u201d Needham said he feels he would have been more supportive of the case if it were filed a few years ago, pre-pandemic. At that time, he said, \"I would have felt, yes Amazon is a monopoly\u2026 But actually after Covid, into 2023, ecommerce has had a lot of big changes.\u201d He added, \"The competition is just not what it was in 2019.\" Competitors like Shopify and Walmart are increasingly viable alternatives for many categories of sellers, Needham said, not to mention rapidly growing Chinese e=commerce companies like Temu. As a result, Needham said he\u2019s seen some significant changes from Amazon. Among those is a greater ability for Amazon sellers to communicate with buyers, offering select customers certain promotions. Shopify, for example, gives sellers much more control over how they communicate with customers, Needham said, adding that although Amazon still controls the communication process, at least there is one. \"I wish it was a clear-cut case,\u201d Needham said. \u201cI have a vested interest in the marketplace doing really well, as a seller and as a service provider. And... this case, it doesn\u2019t make the marketplace better for sellers.\"\n\nConcerns over Amazon pricing policies, fees\n\nMany sellers have zeroed in on Amazon\u2019s pricing policies and rising fees as rightful areas of concern in the FTC's lawsuit. Molson Hart, whose company Viahart sells toys on Amazon, has been a longtime critic of Amazon\u2019s pricing policies. Hart complained of how Amazon\u2019s seller fees impact pricing in a 2019 Medium post and later that year testified about his experience before a House committee. Hart said Amazon sales comprise about 90% of his business, meaning any hit those sales take on Amazon has a considerable impact. He recalled \u201c24 anxious hours\u201d in September 2022 when a third-party seller of his popular construction toy Brain Flakes listed the toy for a lower price on Target than it was offered on Amazon.\n\nMolson Hart, CEO of Viahart, an educational toy company that sells on Amazon.

        "body": "Christmas Day isn't just for the NBA, as the NFL is set to air an exciting triple-header featuring fierce division clashes and a highly anticipated matchup we could see again on Super Bowl Sunday. Here are the top players and storylines to monitor for Monday's slate.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders (6-8) at Kansas City Chiefs (9-5) | 1 p.m. ET\n\nNew chapter in Patrick Mahomes-Maxx Crosby rivalry: This hasn't been as much of a rivalry between the teams as of late, with Kansas City holding a 10-1 record over the Raiders since Mahomes became its starting quarterback. Yet it has sparked an exciting feud between the two-time Super Bowl MVP and the two-time Pro Bowler Crosby, who has five sacks in nine career games against the Chiefs.\n\nMahomes and Crosby might not like facing one another, though it's clear there's mutual respect between the two, which only makes their rivalry more intriguing to watch.\n\nCan Raiders QB Aidan O\u2019Connell earn next season\u2019s starting job?: After leading the offense on seven touchdown scoring drives in last week's 63-21 win over the Chargers, the rookie fourth-rounder aims to further establish himself as a serious contender for Las Vegas' starting job next season. Despite the encouraging performance, O'Connell has been inconsistent across six games as the full-time starter, throwing for 1,300 yards, seven touchdowns, and five interceptions.\n\nHowever, a stellar showing against the NFL's fifth-ranked pass defense (202.5 yards per game allowed) would benefit his bid to be the starter in 2024.\n\nChiefs TE Travis Kelce: Yes, his girlfriend will be in town for the holiday. Kelce is averaging 89.6 yards per game with global popstar Taylor Swift in attendance this season but is coming off his worst outing in her presence, catching five passes for 28 yards.\n\nEven so, Kelce's 81.3 average receiving yards per game against the Raiders since 2019 suggests the All-Pro tight end is in line for a productive outing and could potentially snap his four-game scoring drought.\n\nNew York Giants (5-9) at Philadelphia Eagles (10-4) | 4:30 p.m. ET\n\nWill the Eagles defense shake off the rust?: Appointing Matt Patricia as defensive play-caller didn't change much for the Eagles, whose defense has given up the third-most points in the NFL over their current three-game losing streak (95). Although the unit has reached its lowest point, there are reasons to be optimistic about Monday's matchup.\n\nNew York ranks 31st among teams in points and yards per game this season and has surrendered a staggering 76 sacks, the third-most in a single season in NFL history. Not to mention, the annual trip to Philadelphia has essentially been a scheduled loss for the Giants, with their last win at Lincoln Financial Field coming in 2013.\n\nCan QB Jalen Hurts and the Eagles offense finally bounce back?: Philadelphia's defense isn't the only unit that needs to rebound, as the offense has struggled mightily over the last three games, with Hurts' ineffectiveness playing a significant role. After averaging the third-most points in the NFL over the first 11 games (28.2), the Eagles have scored four offensive touchdowns during their current skid, three of which came via the \"tush push.\"\n\nThe Eagles may have difficulty throwing against a solid Giants pass defense, though they could alleviate some of their offensive woes by running the ball efficiently. New York gives up 131.6 rushing yards per game, the fourth-most in the league.\n\nDoes Giants QB Tommy DeVito have any magic left?: The Giants may have a terrible offense, but this unit has operated at its best under DeVito, an undrafted rookie and native of Cedar Grove, New Jersey.\n\nDeVito has thrown for 858 yards, seven touchdowns, and one interception in five games since being named New York's starting quarterback, posting the 13th-highest passer rating in the NFL during that stretch (97.3).\n\nBaltimore Ravens (11-3) at San Francisco 49ers (11-3) | 8:15 p.m. ET\n\nPotential Super Bowl sneak peek and MVP implications: Easily the most hyped game of the week, with the top seed in each respective conference squaring off in what could be a potential Super Bowl LVIII preview as well as the decisive clash for the MVP Award.\n\nAccording to oddschecker, 49ers QB Brock Purdy is listed as the heavy favorite to be named league MVP (-230), while Baltimore signal-caller Lamar Jackson holds the second-shortest odds (+525).\n\nPurdy, the final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft, has seen his career unfold as if it were a fairy tale that just keeps getting more remarkable. The 23-year-old ranks first in the NFL in QBR (76) and touchdown passes (29) while ranking third in passing yards (3,795), all of which are especially impressive considering he's coming off offseason elbow surgery.\n\nJackson might not be posting the ridiculous numbers he did during his 2019 MVP campaign, but the adjustment in his play style in his first season under OC Todd Monken has led to sustainable, winning football. Nevertheless, Baltimore needs an upset win for Jackson to capture another MVP Award, as he has thrown for 3,105 yards and 17 touchdowns while adding 741 yards on the ground with five scores this season.\n\n49ers RB Christian McCaffrey: If Purdy wasn't playing at such a high level \u2014 and the MVP wasn't a quarterback-driven award \u2014 it'd be difficult to argue against McCaffrey taking home the honors. McCaffrey, who seems poised to win the Offensive Player of the Year Award, leads the NFL in rushing (1,292 yards) and total yards per game (128.6) this season and is tied for first in touchdowns (20).\n\nRavens TE Isaiah Likely thriving in the starting role: The Ravens offense hasn't lost a step since losing one of the team's top weapons in tight end Mark Andrews (ankle) in Week 11, largely due to Likely's emergence.\n\nThe second-year tight end has averaged 64.3 yards over his last three games, which is particularly noteworthy since Andrews averaged 54.4 yards per game before sustaining his injury.\n\nShould we expect a defensive battle?: While both teams boast offenses that rank in the top five in yardage and scoring, this may not turn into a shootout. The Ravens defense has allowed the fewest points per game this season (16.1) and second-fewest total yards (4,030), while San Francisco's unit ranks second in points (16.7) and 10th in yardage (310 per game).\n\nThe 49ers defense might be slightly inferior statistically, but it could have more of an impact in this matchup. San Francisco has racked up an NFL-leading 25 turnovers and has given up the second-fewest rushing yards (1,252), which should help slow down the team with the league's most effective running game."
